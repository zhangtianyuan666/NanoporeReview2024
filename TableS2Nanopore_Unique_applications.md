| Unique Application | Unique Features | Limitation | Ongoing Developments |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Isoform quantification | Ability to capture full-length isoforms, providing detailed views of transcript diversity | Potential for sequencing errors, especially in repetitive regions. | Enhancement of basecalling algorithms and error correction techniques to improve isoform resolution |
| Poly(A) tail | Detects and quantifies poly(A) tails, providing insights into mRNA stability and regulation. | Limited accuracy in quantifying very long poly(A) tails. | Development of specialized protocols and software for enhanced poly(A) tail analysis. |
| Pore-C | Enables long-range contact mapping, facilitating the study of genome architecture and interactions. Supports polyploidy typing and metagenomic binning. | Requires computational tools and resources | Refinement of protocols and bioinformatics tools for better structural resolution |
| Ultra-long DNA sequencing | Generates complete, gapless genome assemblies, including telomeres and centromeres | Challenges in assembling highly repetitive regions | Improve ultra-long experiments and sequencing methods to obtain longer sequences |
| RNA modification | Sequence RNA directly without cDNA conversion, preserving RNA modifications. Directly identifies modifications such as methylation and acetylation without the need for chemical treatments | Higher error rates and lower throughput compared to DNA sequencing | Enhancements in nanopore chemistry and software to improve accuracy and throughput |
| Adaptive sampling | Real-time selective sequencing of regions of interest | Requires sophisticated software and computational resources. | Continued development of adaptive sampling algorithms and integration with other sequencing technologies |
| On-site | Enables rapid, on-site sequencing in various environments, including remote locations. | Limited availability of portable sequencing devices and consumables | Expansion of portable sequencing platforms and development of robust, field-deployable kits |
